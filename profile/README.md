Welcome to the **United Dodgeball League** - the premier competitive organization for Team Fortress 2's Dodgeball gamemode!

## About UDL

The United Dodgeball League is a competitive community dedicated to the TF2 Dodgeball custom gamemode, where players use airblast to deflect rockets back and forth in intense aerial duels.

## What is TF2 Dodgeball?

Dodgeball is a popular Team Fortress 2 custom gamemode where players (as Pyro) must use their airblast to deflect incoming rockets at their opponents. The rockets speed up with each airblast, creating fast-paced, skill-based gameplay that tests reaction time, prediction, and movement mechanics.
